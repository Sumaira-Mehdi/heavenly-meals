I have the following project structure:

my-app (react application)
	- src
	- public_html
	- build (created by react build)
	- backend (expressjs & its routes)
		- dist (react built assets)


Required code changes
---------------------

1. Serve static files from dist folder, add code as following:

	app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "dist")))

2. Must listen to '0.0.0.0' ip address as following:

	const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080; //defining port
	app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', function() {
		console.log(`Port is now running @ ${PORT}`);
	});

3. All urls used in axios/fetch calls in react app should start with '/'. 
   There should not be any host & port in the urls for fetching data from backend, for e.g. see the following code:
   
   axios.get('/admin/faq').then(response => {});


Follow these steps:
--------------------

1. Run `npm run build` in my-app folder, this will build react app and produce js/css/html files in `build` folder
2. Copy all files from build folder into a new folder `dist` (see above - react built assets) within `my-app/backend` folder
3. Push changes
4. Create an app in heroku
5. Connect your github repo in Heroku
6. Deploy your app
